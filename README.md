# Medicinal-Herbs
This project develops a web service with a comprehensive API for medicinal herbs. 
Users can create accounts to explore herbs, select their favorite plants, and access features like a lunar planting calendar, AI-powered recipe suggestions, weather-based care guidance, and safety alerts. It allows users to obtain accurate information efficiently and support the integration of diverse data sources.
